# Tools you are expected to know


Besides knowing how to move about the shell, you are expected to know
how to use these `UNIX` tools:

1. `git` (For version control)
2. `htop` (To see what process are running in real time)
3. `ps` (Snap shot of running processes )
4. `tig` (nicer way to see information about a git repo)
5. `ag` (called the silver-searcher)
6. `aptitude` (for downloading program/libraries on debian based
   distros)
7. `yarn` (the JavaScript package manager)
8. 'diff'(Compare two files)
# Other tools we'll use

1. `atom` (A nice editor for writing programs)
